title: Build your own simple weather display with NodeJS and Arduino
---

In this short guide I'll explain how I built my own desktop weather display on an [Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno) running Node and [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five).

You'll need the following things before starting:

* A 16x2 LCD display, I used the [LCD-WH1602B](http://arduino.cc/documents/datasheets/LCD-WH1602B-TMI.pdf)
* An Arduino board, many will work with this project, but I used an [Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno)
* Different coloured jumper wires
* A potentiometer

### Step 1: Wire it up
